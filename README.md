# CRM-Software-Proposal

This repository contains an old school project where I reviewed a high-level business requirements document and proposed an Agile software solution for a web-based Customer Relationship Management System (CRM). The proposed solution included customizable dashboards for users, a contract management system, a sales tracker, and executive dashboards. I covered everything from goals/objectives, business requirements, software design methodology, visual representations of my solution, and thorough testing including simulated test cases. See TOC below.
